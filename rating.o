The proposed structure does align well with the Clean Architecture approach. It emphasizes the separation of concerns, ensuring that the core business logic (in the domain layer) is decoupled from external concerns like databases and HTTP requests. This separation makes the system more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

Advantages of the Structure:

Modularity: Each app is self-contained, making it easier to develop, test, and understand independently.
Flexibility: The decoupling means you can change the database, framework, or other external components without affecting the core business logic.
Testability: With the separation of concerns, you can easily write unit tests for the domain layer without needing to involve the database or HTTP layer. Integration and end-to-end tests can also be structured more efficiently.
Scalability: As your project grows, you can add more apps or expand existing ones without disrupting the overall architecture.
Considerations:

Learning Curve: For developers new to Clean Architecture, there might be an initial learning curve. They'll need to understand the flow and the purpose of each layer.
Overhead: For very small projects, this architecture might seem like overkill. The benefits become more apparent as the project grows.
Rating:

On a scale of 1 to 10, considering the alignment with Clean Architecture principles and the advantages it brings, I'd rate it around 9. The point deduction is mainly because no architecture is universally perfect; it always depends on the specific needs and context of the project. There might be scenarios or requirements in the future that could necessitate adjustments to the architecture.

In summary, the proposed structure is robust and well-suited for a scalable and maintainable Django project. However, always be open to making adjustments as your project evolves and new requirements emerge.
