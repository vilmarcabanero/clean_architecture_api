  <li> <strong>domain: </strong> This is the core of your application. It contains the business rules, entities, and interfaces that define the operations that can be performed on the entities.

      <li> <strong> entities: </strong> Pure data classes that represent the core business objects. </li>    
      <li> <strong> repositories: </strong> nterfaces that define the operations that can be performed on the entities. The actual implementation of these operations (e.g., database queries) will be in the <strong>data</strong>  layer. </li>    
      <li> <strong> use_cases: </strong> This is where the application-specific business rules reside. They coordinate the flow of data to and from the entities and can be thought of as application-specific operations.</li>

  <li> <strong>data: </strong> This layer interacts with external systems, like databases. It contains the actual implementation of the repository interfaces defined in the <strong> domain </strong> layer.
    <ul>
      <li> <strong> repositories: </strong> Implementations of the repository interfaces from the <strong> domain </strong> layer. They interact with the database and convert between database entities and domain entities.</li>    
      <li> <strong> models: </strong> Django ORM models. These are the actual database entities.</li>    
     </ul>
   </li>
     <li> <strong>views: </strong> This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests, invoking the appropriate use case from the <strong> domain </strong> layer, and returning HTTP responses.

<p> This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, with each layer having a distinct responsibility. The <strong> domain </strong> layer is isolated from external concerns, ensuring that the core business logic is not tied to any specific database, framework, or external agency.

<!-- domain: This is the core of your application. It contains the business rules, entities, and interfaces that define the operations that can be performed on the entities.

entities: Pure data classes that represent the core business objects.

repositories: Interfaces that define the operations that can be performed on the entities. The actual implementation of these operations (e.g., database queries) will be in the data layer.

use_cases: This is where the application-specific business rules reside. They coordinate the flow of data to and from the entities and can be thought of as application-specific operations.

data: This layer interacts with external systems, like databases. It contains the actual implementation of the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

repositories: Implementations of the repository interfaces from the domain layer. They interact with the database and convert between database entities and domain entities.

models: Django ORM models. These are the actual database entities.

views: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests, invoking the appropriate use case from the domain layer, and returning HTTP responses.
